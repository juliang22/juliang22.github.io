                <p>A substantial amount of research has demonstrated that
                    physical activity can have profound effects on cognitive
                    function and mental health. But what are these effects and
                    how significant are they? The DALI lab is partnering with
                    the Dartmouth’s
                    Psychology and Brain Sciences Department to delve into this
                    research and use remote sensing technology to provide more
                    insight into this correlation and potential causation. </p>
                <p>Our team is helping to build a mobile app to conduct this
                    experiment. By using data from Apple watches, particularly
                    Apple Health Kit, we have built an app that will notify our
                    target users—in this case undergraduate psychology
                    students—to
                    complete memory challenges testing their cognition after
                    exercising. ​​ </p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p> At the beginning of this project, there was a clear
                    disconnect between the needs of the researchers and the
                    needs of their users. Our partners, wanting to find a
                    correlation between fitness and memory, needed an app that
                    would record the
                    results of memory tests over an extended period, varying
                    whether or not a user exercised prior to the test. From a
                    research standpoint, this makes sense, for a user, this is
                    strenuous, tedious, and offers them no real benefit. Getting
                    a user to exercise and take a test, for no purpose other
                    than data collection, is an outright impossibility.
                </p>
                <p>To combat this issue, I devised a two-part incentivization
                    system to motivate users to use the app correctly and
                    consistently. In the short-term, I used in-game currency
                    (relating to actual payment for participating in the study),
                    to motivate
                    users to use the app daily: completing all daily tasks
                    results in a certain amount earned. While this collected
                    data accurately, it would not assure consistent app
                    retention. The long-term solution focused around a level-up
                    game-mechanic:
                    a certain amount of days of accurate recording allows the
                    user to reach a new level and receive a bonus amount of
                    money. To fully safeguard this system, a near perfect record
                    would allow the user a chance to win an expensive gift card
                    at the end of the study. I created a system where users were
                    incentivized to use the app correctly (completing all tasks
                    is the only way to earn money) and persistently (each day of
                    data collection got them closer to earning bonus
                    cash and possibly a huge end-of-study prize) </p>
                <div class="h-60"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8">
                <h3 class="not-regular"> Simplify the User Experience</h3>
                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p> Initially, the user flow was simple: each day a user was
                    prompted to unlock a memory test by completing a fitness
                    challenge. Once the fitness challenge was complete, the user
                    could take the memory test, resulting earning in-game
                    currency.
                    This worked up until researchers added a new constraint:
                    there needed to be a substantial delay between the end of
                    the fitness challenge and the beginning of the memory test.
                    Participants were instantly confused as to why, after
                    exercising,
                    they had to “wait” to complete the next part of the study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep the user engaged throughout the app, we decided to
                    indicate the user’s progress as they attempted to complete
                    both the fitness and memory challenges. We split the bar
                    into the three main phases of the app: fitness challenge,
                    waiting period, and
                    memory test. This visual representation of a user’s temporal
                    path through the app, helped users understand where they
                    were in the flow and what to do next.

                    excited to improve their progress within the app. Each
                    memory test was transformed into an entertaining mobile
                    experience
                    with an inviting UI, result-oriented statistics, and a fun
                    avatar.

                <p>With the hopes of “delighting” our users, we created“Brian
                    the Brain”—an avatar that helps guide the user throughout
                    the study. We wanted Brian to be a cute, inviting avatar
                    that would give life to what could be considered mundane.
                    After
                    conducting research on what incentivizes users, we learned
                    that a common behavioral change tactic is through emotional
                    connection. By connecting Brian to the user’s own experience
                    in the app, we noticed that retention increased: users
                    enjoyed seeing Brian’s new accessories and navigated through
                    the app to learn more about him.
