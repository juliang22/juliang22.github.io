                <h3 class="not-regular"> Get Accurate & Consistent Data</h3>
                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p> At the beginning of this project, there was a clear disconnect between the needs of the researchers and the needs of their users. Our partners, wanting to find a correlation between fitness and memory, needed an app that would record the
                    results of memory tests over an extended period, varying whether or not a user exercised prior to the test. From a research standpoint, this makes sense, for a user, this is strenuous, tedious, and offers them no real benefit. Getting
                    a user to exercise and take a test, for no purpose other than data collection, is an outright impossibility.
                </p>
                <p>To combat this issue, I devised a two-part incentivization system to motivate users to use the app correctly and consistently. In the short-term, I used in-game currency (relating to actual payment for participating in the study), to motivate
                    users to use the app daily: completing all daily tasks results in a certain amount earned. While this collected data accurately, it would not assure consistent app retention. The long-term solution focused around a level-up game-mechanic:
                    a certain amount of days of accurate recording allows the user to reach a new level and receive a bonus amount of money. To fully safeguard this system, a near perfect record would allow the user a chance to win an expensive gift card
                    at the end of the study. I created a system where users were incentivized to use the app correctly (completing all tasks is the only way to earn money) and persistently (each day of data collection got them closer to earning bonus
                    cash and possibly a huge end-of-study prize) </p>

                <h3 class="not-regular"> Simplify the User Experience</h3>
                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p> Initially, the user flow was simple: each day a user was prompted to unlock a memory test by completing a fitness challenge. Once the fitness challenge was complete, the user could take the memory test, resulting earning in-game currency.
                    This worked up until researchers added a new constraint: there needed to be a substantial delay between the end of the fitness challenge and the beginning of the memory test. Participants were instantly confused as to why, after exercising,
                    they had to “wait” to complete the next part of the study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To keep the user engaged throughout the app, we decided to indicate the user’s progress as they attempted to complete both the fitness and memory challenges. We split the bar into the three main phases of the app: fitness challenge, waiting period, and
                    memory test. This visual representation of a user’s temporal path through the app, helped users understand where they were in the flow and what to do next.

                <h3> Gamificiation </h3>
                <p>The first step was gamification: by making each test—as well as the app as a whole—a series of challenges, user’s were excited to improve their progress within the app. Each memory test was transformed into an entertaining mobile experience
                    with an inviting UI, result-oriented statistics, and a fun avatar.

                <p>With the hopes of “delighting” our users, we created“Brian the Brain”—an avatar that helps guide the user throughout the study. We wanted Brian to be a cute, inviting avatar that would give life to what could be considered mundane. After
                    conducting research on what incentivizes users, we learned that a common behavioral change tactic is through emotional connection. By connecting Brian to the user’s own experience in the app, we noticed that retention increased: users
                    enjoyed seeing Brian’s new accessories and navigated through the app to learn more about him.
