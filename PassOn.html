                <p>Learning and social connection on college campuses are
                    wrongfully mutually exclusive. Constrained by social norms
                    and a lacking infrastructure for nurturing growth, colleges
                    everywhere neglect accessing the full potential of their
                    students.
                    Learning should not be sequestered to the classroom alone,
                    it should be something that students have the opportunity to
                    engage in at any point in their day, from any source. </p>

                    belief that we all have an innate desire to both learn and
                    share. Learn how to yoyo from a competition-oriented
                    professional, have an hour-long lesson with top-notch

                    hone your tennis abilities with a skilled player: through
                    expensing or trading skills, social interaction and learning
                    can be combined into one holistic experience.</p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p>Skill acquisition is centered around two distinct points —
                    teaching and learning — and, while both are necessary parts
                    of the skill acquisition process, I believed the main buy-in
                    for users is focused around the aspect of learning. While
                    both sides are essential to a skill-sharing platform, I
                    theorized that engagement must be focused around the user
                    themselves: what they want precedes what others desire. I
                    believed the app should function as free market: user’s
                    place
                    value on other people’s products and offer their own as
                    compensation. The initial interest has to be on the side of
                    learning; only then will the majority agents be willing to
                    share their skills. </p>
                <p>We designed our primary user-flow on this ‘learn-oriented’
                    concept: onboarding refines a user’s interests to teachable
                    skills and the home page presents them with a list of users
                    teaching those skills. The user finds a suitable teacher
                    and is prompted to exchange something they can teach for the
                    skills they want to learn. They then are guided to create a
                    ‘skill card,’ much like the one that they just interacted
                    with, to add to their profile and offer to that user.
                    Usability testing proved that this was an intuitive process:
                    users smoothly navigated through the learn-oriented screens
                    with little confusion and generally felt comfortable adding
                    their passion to exchange once an appropriate teacher
                    had been found. </p>

                <div class="h-10"></div>
                <p> The actual process of proposing a connection is one of the
                    most important steps in any social network. As such, I
                    believed this particular step must have some nuance beyond
                    merely finding and connecting to potential teachers; users
                    should
                    feel comfortable both sending and receiving new connections.
                    Hoping to mitigate the potential fear of reaching out to new
                    people, as well as any nervousness associated with a
                    stranger reaching out to you, I thought it was important
                    for users to both have granular control over their
                    interactions and to be presented with only relevant
                    information upon initial interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In regards to granular control, I thought it was important
                    to frame connections are the concept of ‘requests.’ Much
                    like Facebook friend requests, users should be able to
                    determine who they want to interact with. Going one step
                    further, the introduction
                    between two strangers should be as seamless and standardized
                    as possible. Thus, a request is initiated with the necessary
                    information of what proposed exchange would look like and
                    the information is presented to the associated party
                    in a generated format. The users can proceed to negotiate
                    the terms of the exchange (what passions being shared,
                    timing of each session, potential monetary compensation)
                    through the layer of a generated format, before the
                    connection
                    is approved and users can message each other freely.

                <p>Our user testing showed that many users have some
                    apprehension around communicating and meeting strangers.
                    Instead of neglecting these fears, I found a way to address
                    them head on. Users suspected certain trades would feel
                    unequal so we
                    made mutual agreement a prerequisite of connection; users
                    expressed the process of bartering could be awkward so we
                    made the other user robotic up until the point where
                    consensus is reached; users relayed a fear of having random
                    people
                    message them so we created the barrier of requests and their
                    ability to be declined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In each of these cases, users expressed a sentiment in
                    direct conflict with the premise of our app as a whole.
                    While it was disheartening hearing so many concerns with the
                    app’s interaction as a whole, empathizing with these beliefs
                    was the single greatest
                    turning point of this app. A few intense design sessions
                    later and our user experience was refined to the point where
                    is was actually usable. Users responded by intuitively
                    navigated our new interface and expressed no hesitation or
                    concern with reaching out to new people. Success!

                    A returning user lands first on the ‘Home’ page, which
                    offers the user a sample list of possible matches that share
                    their interests. Everyone in the ‘Double Matches’ list can
                    teach the user a skill they’re interested in and wish to
                    learn something that
                    the user is an expert in. All of this matching is
                    personalized, based on the user’s profile. The user also has
                    the option to execute a quick search for a specific user or
                    skill, if they know what they are looking for.

                    Messaging takes a unique turn in PassOn. Through our user
                    research, we found that planning with other people can often
                    be a lengthy, messy, and frustrating process via text. So we
                    decided to ease this experience by having a ‘Proposal’
                    feature. A user
                    who wishes to reach out to a peer can propose a ‘skill
                    trade,’ where they set what they wish to teach and what they
                    wish to learn.

                <p> I would also like to thank my wonderful team for their hard
                    work, passion, and dedication to success. From both a
                    development and design perspective, this was quite a hefty
                    project; I am proud of their persistence, teamwork, and
                    engagement
                    in the process of innovation. Finally, a huge thank you to
                    Lorie Loeb, Natalie Jung, and Tim Tregubov for their
